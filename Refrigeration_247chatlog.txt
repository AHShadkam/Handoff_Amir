I need to schedule a repair appointment for my Kenmore Refrigerator. It's dispensing slower than it was when the technician arrived on 1/23.
Hello, my refrigerator is about 2 months old and doesn't dispense water or produce ice anymore.
My fridge water dispenser quit working. I need to get it fixed. I'm pretty sure it is still under warranty.
I need a repairman to come to my home to fix the freezer/ice/icemaker. It is not making ice.
It is not spinning on any cycle or option.
It is a Kenmore Elite French Door Fridge. It has a simple display on the front with lights for water, cubed, and crushed ice. Those lights keep turning off, and the display doesn't work, but the fridge is still cold. When I unplug it and plug it back in, the lights come back on, but they don't stay on. And the water dispenser isn't working at all.
I have a Kenmore French Door bottom freezer not making ice.
My refrigerator was serviced a week or so ago and the water and ice will not work. 
the freezer will not keep things frozen and the center strip between the freezer and fringe gets extremely hot.
it's leaking from somewhere.
the ice maker will not stop making ice.
I have a Samsung refrigerater model # RF28HFEDBSR/AA . S/N is 065K43AG905679E,  IT IS LEAKING FROM BOTTOM FRONT LEFT CORNER.
I need service on my new refrigerator, ice maker is not making ice.
The ice maker on our refrigerator is not making ice.
the water/ice dispenser and freezer are not working.
the front dispenser is leaking water.
I bought a kenmore fridge last november. the light fixture no longer works.
