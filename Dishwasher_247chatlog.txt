Hi my name is Monica, I need help scheduling repair and maintenance on my dishwasher.the top rack plastic parts have broken and the front of the rack dips down just enough for me to use it but it is not level. And I would like maintenance.
For the past few months our dishwasher has not been cleaning properly.
the dishwasher's top basket seems to have lost a major part to keep it in the track, so it just falls off.
my dishwasher tracks are falling off.
our dishwasher door is not closing. We have checked the racks and there is nothing blocking them.
the top rack of my dishwasher is broken.
The small plastic wheels connecting the top basket to the pull out brace have snapped, causing the top basket to tilt forward. It will not hold any weight in the top basket. It throws the whole wash cycle off.
Hi, the wheels are broken on the lower rack of my dishwasher
My dishwasher intermittently does not drain at end very end of cycle. It dries dishes (sort of) with standing water in bottom of machine.
The dishwasher is still not washing as well as it did last month.
