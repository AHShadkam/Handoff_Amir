It is not starting when we close the lid. It all started with the lid needing extra pressure to get it going.
the washer is not runing it keep making noise but not going on.
I need to schedule a repair on a washing machine that is under warranty.It is not spinning on any cycle or option.
spin cycle does not work.
We purchased a new front load washer in August(I believe) and the front door continually leaks. 
I have a washing machine that is leaking from the bottom.
The washing machine stopped mid cycle and it will not turn back on.
I was wondering if by chance someone knew how to reset the washer.
There are some settings that aren't working on the Washer. When we turn on the settings the light next to the temp of the water doesn't turn on
The washer went of balance and since then is making lots of noise on the spin sycle.
My Washer stopped working yesterday. Did not drain the tub, and when you ask for spin/dry only, it just makes a whirring noise and does not spin the drum.
